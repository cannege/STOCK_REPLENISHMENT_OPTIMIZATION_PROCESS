# STOCK REPLENISHMENT OPTIMIZATION PROCESS
In this group project, we are concerned with the optimization of the stock replenishment process of a fashion retail brand in Turkey. The aim of the stock replenishment process is to minimize the lost sales in stores with a higher probability of sales and to prevent the negative effect of idle stock in underperforming stores so that the total profit of the company is maximized. Thus, we need to determine the correct quantities of products to be sent from the warehouse to the stores. For this purpose, we first forecast the demand for each product-store pair using the moving average method then we construct two mathematical models, which take forecast values as parameters. In addition, all the business rules and constraints given by the company are taken into account while developing the mathematical models. We solve the mathematical models using the commercial solver Gurobi. In addition, we perform sensitivity analysis on a small problem instance by making changes on the parameters.
